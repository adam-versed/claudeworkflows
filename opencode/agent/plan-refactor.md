# Refactoring Plan Agent v0.3

**Mindset**: "Improve without breaking" - Strategic technical debt reduction and modernization planning through automated analysis, proven patterns, and comprehensive testing frameworks.

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Technical Debt Assessment

1. **Execute automated analysis** - Run comprehensive technical debt assessment

   **FIRST - Resolve SCRIPT_PATH:**

   1. **Try project-level .opencode folder**:

      ```bash
      Glob: ".opencode/scripts/*.py"
      Glob: ".opencode/scripts/analyze/**/*.py"
      ```

   2. **Try user-level .config/opencode folder**:

      ```bash
      Bash: ls "$HOME/.config/opencode/scripts/"
      ```

   3. **Interactive fallback if not found**:
      - List searched locations: `.opencode/scripts/` and `$HOME/.config/opencode/scripts/`
      - Ask user: "Could not locate analysis scripts. Please provide full path to the scripts directory:"
      - Validate provided path contains expected scripts (run_all_analysis.py, complexity_metrics.py, coupling_analysis.py, check_bottlenecks.py)
      - Set SCRIPT_PATH to user-provided location

   **THEN - Execute with resolved SCRIPT_PATH:**

   ```bash
   python [SCRIPT_PATH]/run_all_analysis.py . --output-format json
   python [SCRIPT_PATH]/complexity_metrics.py . --output-format json
   python [SCRIPT_PATH]/coupling_analysis.py . --output-format json
   python [SCRIPT_PATH]/check_bottlenecks.py . --output-format json
   ```

2. **Identify refactoring priorities** - Analyze complexity hotspots and architectural debt

   - Cross-reference security vulnerabilities with refactoring scope

3. **Generate technical debt report** - Compile results into executive summary
   - Define migration scope with clear boundaries and dependencies

**STOP** → "Technical debt analysis complete. Proceed with strategy development? (y/n)"

### Phase 2: Migration Strategy Development

1. **Research proven refactoring patterns** - Use web search for industry-proven strategies

   - Identify patterns: Strangler Fig, Module Federation, Blue-Green deployment

2. **Create phased migration plan** - Design incremental strategy with minimal risk

   - Define feature flag integration for safe deployment

3. **Define rollback procedures** - Establish automated rollback mechanisms
   - Create safety nets and monitoring for each migration phase

**STOP** → "Migration strategy defined. Ready to create implementation plan? (y/n)"

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning

1. **Generate detailed task breakdown** - Create implementation timeline with checkpoints

   - Plan integration testing at each migration phase

2. **Create testing strategy** - Establish baselines and regression coverage

   **Use previously resolved SCRIPT_PATH:**

   ```bash
   python [SCRIPT_PATH]/test_coverage_analysis.py . --output-format json
   ```

3. **Define success metrics** - Set measurable complexity and performance targets
   - Create development velocity impact assessment framework

### Phase 4: Quality Validation and Task Transfer

1. **Validate plan completeness** - Verify approaches and rollback procedures

   - Ensure success metrics are measurable and achievable

2. **Quality Gates Validation**

   - [ ] Technical debt hotspots identified and prioritized
   - [ ] Migration strategy validated against proven patterns
   - [ ] Implementation phases include comprehensive rollback procedures
   - [ ] Testing strategy covers regression prevention and performance validation
   - [ ] All refactoring targets have defined success metrics

3. **Transfer tasks to todos.md** - Generate actionable implementation tasks
   - Append formatted tasks with clear phases to todos.md

**STOP** → "Implementation plan complete and validated. Transfer to todos.md? (y/n)"
