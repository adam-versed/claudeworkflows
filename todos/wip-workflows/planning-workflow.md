✻ Thinking…

The user wants me to analyze the "todos/PRPs-agentic-eng" directory to understand how it works as a task documentation workflow approach for
working with code assist agent tools. They want a comprehensive, detailed report on:

1. How it works
2. Flow through the system
3. How each element contributes to that flow
4. Use this analysis to see how to breakdown this approach
5. Use the format from @claude-code/commands/plan-ux-prd.md to create a new orchestration flow
6. Similar to @claude-code/commands/todo-orchestrate.md but specifically for creating project documentation
7. Incorporate learnings from all these approaches for a code assist agent to implement

First I need to analyze the todos/PRPs-agentic-eng directory to understand its structure and approach.

⏺ PRPs-Agentic-Eng: Comprehensive Analysis Report

Executive Summary

The PRPs-agentic-eng system represents a sophisticated Product Requirement Prompt (PRP) Framework designed to enable AI agents to achieve
one-pass implementation success through comprehensive context engineering. Unlike traditional Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), PRPs combine
business requirements with curated codebase intelligence, implementation blueprints, and executable validation gates.

Core Innovation: PRP = PRD + curated codebase intelligence + agent/runbook - providing the minimum viable context packet for production-ready
code generation.
