## Installation Details

### Installation Options

```bash
# Current directory (uses ./.claude/)
./install.sh

# User global (uses ~/.claude/)
./install.sh ~

# Custom location
./install.sh /my/project/path

# Advanced options
./install.sh --dry-run       # Preview changes without making modifications
./install.sh --verbose      # Enable detailed debug output
./install.sh --skip-mcp     # Skip MCP tools installation (Python scripts only)
./install.sh --skip-python  # Skip Python dependencies installation
./install.sh --help         # Show detailed help and usage information
```

### Handling Existing .Claude Installations

**Automatic Backup:** All installation options automatically create a timestamped backup of your existing installation before making any changes.

The installer automatically detects existing `.claude` directories and the interactive terminal install will offer four options:

1. **Fresh Install:** install fresh (complete replacement)
2. **Merge:** Preserve user customizations while adding new features (no overwrites)
3. **Update Workflows Only:** Update built-in commands and scripts while preserving custom commands and all other files (recommended for updates)
4. **Cancel:** Exit without changes

## Uninstalling

To safely remove Claude Code Workflows components while preserving your .claude directory:

```bash
# Preview what would be removed (recommended first step)
./uninstall.sh --dry-run

# Uninstall from current directory
./uninstall.sh

# Uninstall from specific path
./uninstall.sh /path/to/installation

# Verbose output for detailed logging
./uninstall.sh --verbose
```

**Smart Uninstall Features:**

- **üì¶ Safe Removal**: Only removes workflow components, preserves .claude structure and user files
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Dependency Tracking**: Distinguishes pre-existing vs newly installed Python packages/MCP servers
- **üíæ Automatic Backups**: Creates backups of MCP configuration and claude.md before changes
- **üßπ Thorough Cleanup**: Removes **pycache** folders and empty directories
- **üìù Installation Log**: Uses installation-log.txt to provide intelligent removal warnings

The uninstaller will interactively prompt for each Python package and MCP server removal, showing whether each item was:

- **üîß Newly installed** by Claude Code Workflows (safer to remove)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-existing** before installation (likely used by other projects - caution advised)

## Security Analysis Details

### OWASP Top 10 Coverage

The security analysis provides comprehensive OWASP testing criteria coverage through automated vulnerability detection.

```bash
/analyze-security
```

**Detected Issues:**

- **A01: Injection** ‚Üí SQL injection in authentication
- **A02: Cryptographic Failures** ‚Üí Hardcoded JWT secrets
- **A03: Injection** ‚Üí Command injection via eval()
- **A07: Identity Failures** ‚Üí Weak authentication patterns

## Development Monitoring

### Overview

The `setup-dev-monitoring` command establishes comprehensive development monitoring infrastructure for any project structure through LLM-driven analysis and cross-platform automation. This workflow provides centralized logging, server start/stop control, and key event capture for LLM integration - inspired by @mitsuhiko's development workflow approach.

### Key Benefits

**Centralized Development Control:**

- **Unified logging** - All development services (frontend, backend, databases) log to a single aggregated file
- **Service orchestration** - Start/stop all development services with simple commands
- **Status monitoring** - Quick health checks across all project components
- **Event capture** - Key development events automatically formatted for LLM analysis

**LLM Integration Advantages:**

- **Context-rich debugging** - Claude can read unified logs to understand full system state
- **Intelligent troubleshooting** - Complete request/response flows captured for analysis
- **Automated issue detection** - Patterns across services identified through log analysis
- **Streamlined workflows** - No need to manually gather logs from multiple terminals

### Setup Process

The setup command uses intelligent project analysis to automatically:

1. **Discover project components** - Analyzes structure to identify all runnable services
2. **Install monitoring dependencies** - Cross-platform installation of required tools
3. **Generate orchestration files** - Creates Makefile and Procfile for service management
4. **Configure log aggregation** - Sets up unified logging with service-specific labels
5. **Validate setup** - Tests monitoring infrastructure before completion

### Generated Commands

After setup, your project gains these development commands:

```bash
# Start all development services with unified logging
make dev

# Access aggregated logs for debugging and LLM analysis
make tail-log

# Check service health and status
make status

# Stop all development services
make stop

# Code quality and testing
make lint
make test
make format
make clean
```

**Note:** Claude follows strict service management policies - it can read logs and check status, but users must manually run `make dev` and `make stop` commands for security.

## Special Notes

### Todo workflow

CC commands come from [badlogic](https://github.com/badlogic/claude-commands/blob/main/todo.md) - pairs well with the workflows, particularly /plan-\* as they produce todo.md lists. It's a more efficient version of CC plan mode/todos, but ive modified it to use Claude.md rather than a bespoke file for project description.

### Recommended Optionals

- **Context7 MCP** best practice documentation to support code generation
- **Sequential thinking MCP** use to breakdown complex tasks (can augment or cheaper alternative for non reasoning models)
