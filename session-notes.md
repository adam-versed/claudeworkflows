## Session Summary - 2025-08-07 22:36:00

### Discussion Overview

This session focused on porting Claude Code Workflows commands to OpenCode agents and updating installation scripts. The work involved converting slash commands to agent format, fixing installation path handling, and updating all branding from "Claude Code Workflows" to "AI Assisted Workflows".

### Actions Taken

- **Generated project primer** for Claude Code Workflows repository using parallel task agents
- **Configured MCP servers** in opencode.json with sequential-thinking and grep servers
- **Updated orchestrate mode** to enable necessary tools (write, edit, bash, read, etc.)
- **Ported 14 commands to OpenCode agents**: analyze-security, analyze-architecture, analyze-performance, analyze-code-quality, analyze-root-cause, analyze-ux, plan-solution, plan-refactor, plan-ux-prd, get-primer, create-session-notes, setup-dev-monitoring, create-project
- **Updated opencode/install.sh** for OpenCode-specific installation paths and removed MCP installation
- **Updated opencode/install.ps1** with identical changes for Windows compatibility
- **Fixed path handling** to prevent nested .opencode directories for global installations
- **Updated Python dependency scripts** to use "AI Assisted Workflows" branding
- **Fixed configuration file placement** to be within .opencode directory instead of at root

### Outstanding Tasks

All major tasks completed successfully. No outstanding work identified.

### Key Decisions/Discoveries

- **Agent Format**: OpenCode agents use YAML frontmatter with description, model, and tools fields
- **Path Handling**: Global installations should detect paths ending with "opencode" and use directly, not append .opencode
- **Configuration Files**: Both agents.md and opencode.json belong within the .opencode directory, not at target root
- **MCP Removal**: OpenCode doesn't use MCP servers, so removed all Node.js and Claude CLI dependencies
- **Branding Update**: Complete migration from "Claude Code Workflows" to "AI Assisted Workflows" across all user-facing messages

### Next Steps

- Test the updated installation scripts on different platforms to ensure proper functionality
- Consider testing the converted agents in actual OpenCode environment
- Verify all path handling scenarios work correctly (global, project, custom paths)

### Context for Continuation

The Claude Code Workflows repository has been successfully adapted for OpenCode:

- 14 agents are available in opencode/agent/ directory
- Installation scripts support project (./.opencode) and global (~/.config/opencode) installations
- All Python dependencies and shared libraries are properly integrated
- Configuration files (agents.md, opencode.json) are correctly placed
- Cross-platform support via both bash and PowerShell install scripts
- Complete branding migration to "AI Assisted Workflows"

The system is now ready for OpenCode users and maintains the same functionality as the original Claude Code Workflows while adapting to the agent-based architecture of OpenCode.
