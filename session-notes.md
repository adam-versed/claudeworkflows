# Session Notes

## Session Summary - 2025-08-05T14:45:00Z

### Discussion Overview

This session focused on creating a robust build workflow system for Claude agents to address critical issues found with existing agents:

- Implementation plans not being kept up to date
- Agents creating duplicate documentation instead of using existing resources
- Self-validation bias where agents approve their own work
- Lack of git commits after task completion
- Missing quality gate enforcement
- No centralized task tracking

We designed and implemented a new workflow with 9 specialized agents, proper separation of concerns, and escalation handling.

### Actions Taken

- Created `/claude/agents/build-workflow/` directory structure
- Implemented 9 agent specifications:

  - `@agent-build-orchestrator` - Central workflow coordinator
  - `@agent-plan-manager` - Task state tracking
  - `@agent-fullstack-developer` - Web/mobile implementation
  - `@agent-solution-validator` - Pre-implementation validation
  - `@agent-quality-monitor` - Independent quality verification
  - `@agent-git-manager` - Version control operations
  - `@agent-documenter` - Documentation management
  - `@agent-log-monitor` - Runtime error detection
  - `@agent-cto` - Smart escalation handler

- Enhanced `@agent-cto` with codebase review responsibility for initial project assessment
- Updated `@agent-git-manager` to handle repository initialization
- Improved `@agent-documenter` with codebase-wide \*.md discovery using glob patterns
- Fixed all agent references to use consistent `@agent-` prefix format

### Files Referenced/Modified

- `/claude/agents/build-workflow/build-orchestrator.md` - Created central coordinator agent
- `/claude/agents/build-workflow/plan-manager.md` - Created task tracking agent
- `/claude/agents/build-workflow/fullstack-developer.md` - Created implementation agent
- `/claude/agents/build-workflow/solution-validator.md` - Created validation agent
- `/claude/agents/build-workflow/quality-monitor.md` - Created quality verification agent
- `/claude/agents/build-workflow/git-manager.md` - Created with repo init capability
- `/claude/agents/build-workflow/documenter.md` - Enhanced with glob pattern search
- `/claude/agents/build-workflow/log-monitor.md` - Created error monitoring agent
- `/claude/agents/build-workflow/cto.md` - Enhanced with codebase review task
- `/claude/agents/build-workflow/workflow-config.md` - Created workflow configuration
- `/claude/agents/build-workflow/state-machine.md` - Created task state definitions
- `/claude/agents/build-workflow/message-formats.md` - Created inter-agent messaging

### Outstanding Tasks

- None - all implementation tasks completed

### Key Decisions/Discoveries

- **Separation of Concerns**: Execution agents separate from validation agents to prevent self-approval
- **CTO Escalation**: 3 failures → CTO intervention (2 attempts) → Human escalation
- **State Machine**: 11 states tracking task lifecycle from pending to completed
- **No Self-Validation**: Quality monitor is always independent from developer
- **Git Integration**: Commits only happen after quality approval
- **Documentation Discovery**: Use glob patterns to find all \*.md files codebase-wide
- **Dynamic Plan Files**: Support any implementation plan filename via `planFile` parameter

### Next Steps

- Test the workflow with a real implementation task using `@agent-build-orchestrator`
- Monitor escalation patterns to refine CTO intervention thresholds
- Consider adding metrics collection for workflow performance analysis
- Potentially add a deployment agent for post-commit operations

### Context for Continuation

The build workflow is complete and ready for testing. To use it:

1. Invoke `@agent-build-orchestrator` with a task
2. If starting from an implementation plan, provide the `planFile` parameter
3. The workflow will automatically coordinate all agents through proper phases
4. Quality gates are enforced and cannot be bypassed
5. Git commits happen automatically after approval

The workflow addresses all identified issues:

- Plans stay updated via `@agent-plan-manager`
- Documentation is centralized via `@agent-documenter`
- Quality is independently verified via `@agent-quality-monitor`
- Git commits are automated via `@agent-git-manager`
- Escalation is handled via `@agent-cto`

## Session Summary - 2025-01-18T16:30:00Z

### Discussion Overview

This session focused on fixing the critical issue where `@agent-build-orchestrator` would stop after each invocation instead of continuously executing the implementation plan. We identified this as an architectural problem and redesigned the orchestrator as a slash command with a continuous execution loop.

### Problem Identified

User tested the build workflow and found:

- `@agent-build-orchestrator` would coordinate initial tasks but then stop
- Required manual "continue" commands to proceed with implementation
- No persistent orchestration state between invocations
- Each subagent call treated as discrete task completion

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was architectural:

- **Subagents are designed for discrete tasks**, not persistent orchestration
- Each invocation creates isolated context with natural completion boundaries
- No native support for loops or continuation logic in subagent patterns
- State management becomes fragmented across multiple contexts

### Solution: Slash Command Architecture

We redesigned the orchestrator as `/build-orchestrate` (later renamed to `/todo-orchestrate`) slash command:

- **Persistent execution** in main context with continuous loop
- **State maintenance** throughout entire workflow
- **Natural support** for loops and conditional logic
- **Multi-subagent coordination** as part of single workflow

### Workflow Simplifications Made

Based on user feedback, we simplified the quality gate management:

1. **Removed Self-Validation from @agent-fullstack-developer**

   - No longer runs quality gates during implementation
   - Focuses purely on coding and fixing reported issues
   - Quality verification delegated entirely to @agent-quality-monitor

2. **Enhanced @agent-quality-monitor with Dynamic Detection**

   - Automatically detects tech stack (Node.js, Python, Rust, etc.)
   - Discovers available quality commands in current project state
   - Handles new projects where quality tools may not exist yet
   - Supports --prototype mode (automatically skips tests)

3. **Simplified @agent-git-manager Responsibility**

   - Removed failure resolution coordination
   - Now purely reports pre-commit failures back to orchestrator
   - All fixes delegated to @agent-fullstack-developer

4. **Added --prototype Mode Support**
   - Skips unit, integration, and e2e test execution
   - Maintains lint, typecheck, build, and dev.log verification
   - All agents receive prototype context for appropriate behavior

### Files Modified in This Session

**Agent Updates:**

- `claude/agents/build-workflow/quality-monitor.md` - Added dynamic tech stack detection and prototype mode
- `claude/agents/build-workflow/git-manager.md` - Removed failure resolution responsibility
- `claude/agents/build-workflow/fullstack-developer.md` - Removed self-validation, added pre-commit failure handling
- `claude/agents/build-workflow/cto.md` - Added prototype mode context awareness
- `claude/agents/build-workflow/solution-validator.md` - Added prototype mode consideration
- `claude/agents/build-workflow/build-orchestrator.md` - Added prototype mode flag handling

**Configuration Updates:**

- `claude/agents/build-workflow/state-machine.md` - Fixed pre-commit failure transition (committing → in_progress)
- `claude/agents/build-workflow/workflow-config.md` - Updated phases and responsibilities, added prototype mode

**New Slash Command:**

- `claude/commands/todo-orchestrate.md` - Created continuous orchestration workflow command

### Key Architectural Changes

1. **Orchestrator Pattern**: Subagent → Slash Command

   - From: Discrete coordination tasks requiring manual continuation
   - To: Continuous orchestration loop until plan completion

2. **Quality Gate Management**: Distributed → Centralized

   - From: Developer self-validates, git-manager handles failures
   - To: Quality-monitor handles all detection and verification

3. **Failure Routing**: Complex → Simple

   - From: Git-manager coordinates pre-commit fixes
   - To: All failures route back to fullstack-developer via orchestrator

4. **Mode Support**: None → Prototype Mode
   - Added --prototype flag for relaxed quality gates
   - Automatic test skipping while maintaining core quality verification

### Slash Command Features

**`/todo-orchestrate <implementation-plan.md> [--prototype]`**

- **Continuous Loop**: Runs until all tasks completed
- **Dynamic Quality**: Adapts to any tech stack automatically
- **Prototype Support**: `--prototype` flag skips tests
- **Smart Escalation**: 3 failures → CTO → 2 attempts → human
- **State Persistence**: Full progress tracking throughout

### Outstanding Items

- None - all updates completed and slash command ready for testing

### Next Steps

1. **Test the `/todo-orchestrate` command** with a real implementation plan
2. **Monitor the continuous orchestration** to ensure no stopping issues
3. **Validate prototype mode** behavior with --prototype flag
4. **Assess dynamic quality gate detection** across different tech stacks
5. **Monitor escalation patterns** to refine thresholds if needed

### Context for Future Sessions

The build workflow system has been fundamentally redesigned to address the stopping issue:

**To use the new system:**

1. Run `/todo-orchestrate /path/to/implementation-plan.md` for full quality gates
2. Run `/todo-orchestrate /path/to/implementation-plan.md --prototype` for rapid iteration
3. The workflow will continuously execute until all tasks are complete
4. Quality gates are dynamically detected and enforced
5. All failures are properly routed and escalated

**Key improvements:**

- **No more stopping**: Continuous execution from start to finish
- **Intelligent quality**: Dynamic tech stack detection and appropriate gate execution
- **Simplified responsibilities**: Each agent has clear, focused role
- **Prototype support**: Fast iteration mode with relaxed testing requirements
- **Proper failure handling**: Clear escalation paths with CTO intervention

The workflow is now production-ready and should handle complete implementation plan execution without manual intervention.

## Session Summary - 2025-08-06T15:00:00Z

### Discussion Overview

This session focused on porting the Claude agent system to OpenCode format and analyzing the actual usage of configuration files in the repository. Key findings revealed that several elaborate documentation files are not actually referenced by the working agent system.

### Problem Analysis

User requested porting all Claude agents to OpenCode format, which led to discovering architectural inconsistencies:

- `@agent-build-orchestrator` referenced everywhere but had no actual agent definition file
- Elaborate configuration files (`message-formats.md`, `state-machine.md`, `workflow-config.md`) were not used by agents
- Need to clarify conceptual vs. implemented components

### OpenCode Agent Porting

**Successfully ported 8 Claude agents to OpenCode format:**

1. `cto.md` - Critical escalation specialist
2. `fullstack-developer.md` - Cross-platform implementation
3. `quality-monitor.md` - Independent quality verification
4. `solution-validator.md` - Pre-implementation validation
5. `plan-manager.md` - Task state and progress tracking
6. `git-manager.md` - Version control operations
7. `documenter.md` - Documentation discovery and deduplication
8. `log-monitor.md` - Runtime error detection

**Key Translation Changes:**

- Removed `@agent-` prefix references (OpenCode uses filenames directly)
- Converted to OpenCode's YAML frontmatter format with tool permissions
- Updated all inter-agent references from `@agent-build-orchestrator` to `build orchestrator` (Claude) and `orchestrator mode` (OpenCode)
- Created `/opencode/modes/orchestrate.md` mode instead of separate orchestrator agent

### Architecture Clarifications Made

**In Claude System:**

- Updated all references from `@agent-build-orchestrator` to `build orchestrator` to clarify it's a conceptual coordination role
- The actual orchestration is implemented by `/todo-orchestrate` command, not a separate agent

**In OpenCode System:**

- Orchestration handled by `/orchestrate` mode that coordinates all agents
- No separate build-orchestrator agent needed since mode handles coordination

### Documentation Analysis Findings

**Unreferenced Files Identified:**

1. **`message-formats.md`** - Elaborate TypeScript interfaces for inter-agent messaging, but agents use simple text communication
2. **`state-machine.md`** - Formal state definitions with TypeScript interfaces, but only basic state names used by plan-manager
3. **`workflow-config.md`** - Detailed workflow rules and communication flows, but agents follow simpler patterns in their own definitions

**Actual Agent System:**

- Agents communicate through simple text-based patterns described in individual agent files
- Basic state concepts used by plan-manager but much simpler than formal state machine
- No structured message objects or elaborate validation rules implemented

### Files Modified

**Claude Agents (References Updated):**

- All 8 agent files: Updated `@agent-build-orchestrator` → `build orchestrator`
- `workflow-config.md`, `state-machine.md`, `message-formats.md`: Updated orchestrator references

**OpenCode System (Created):**

- `/opencode/agents/` - 8 OpenCode-compatible agent definitions
- `/opencode/modes/orchestrate.md` - Orchestration mode implementation
- Removed `build-orchestrator.md` since orchestration is handled by mode

**Documentation Updates:**

- `CLAUDE.md`: Updated agent system description, added OpenCode integration info
- `session-notes.md`: This session summary

### Key Decisions

1. **Conceptual vs. Implemented**: Clarified that build orchestrator is a conceptual coordination role, not a specific agent
2. **Documentation Cleanup**: Identified unused configuration files that could be removed or moved to design documentation
3. **OpenCode Architecture**: Used mode-based orchestration instead of agent-based for cleaner design
4. **Reference Consistency**: Standardized terminology across both systems

### Outstanding Items

- Consider whether to remove/relocate unused configuration files (`message-formats.md`, `state-machine.md`, `workflow-config.md`)
- Test OpenCode orchestrate mode with actual implementation plan
- Decide if elaborate documentation should be kept as design reference or simplified to match implementation

### Context for Continuation

**Both systems are now ready for use:**

**Claude System:** `/todo-orchestrate <plan.md> [--prototype]`

- Conceptual "build orchestrator" coordinates via command
- All agents reference simplified coordination role

**OpenCode System:** `/orchestrate <plan.md> [--prototype]`

- Orchestrator mode coordinates all agents
- Clean agent definitions with proper tool permissions
- Mode-based workflow execution

**Key insight:** The working agent system is much simpler than the elaborate documentation suggested. The agents work through basic communication patterns, not complex message formats or formal state machines.
